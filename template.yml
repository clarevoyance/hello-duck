# This file shows all currently available nodes in peekingduck

nodes:
# input
- input.live # Reads a videofeed from a stream, e.g., webcam.

- input.recorded # Reads video/images from a directory.
## input: None
## output: 
### `img` (np.ndarray): representation of image in BGR format in height, width, channel
### `pipeline_end` (bool): Evaluates as `True` when pipeline is completed.
### `filename` (str): The filename of video/image being read
### `saved_video_fps` (float): The FPS of the recorded video upon filming

# dabble
- dabble.bbox_count # Counts the number of detected boxes.
- dabble.bbox_to_3d_loc # Estimates the 3D coordinates of an object given a 2D bounding box.
- dabble.bbox_to_btm_midpoint # Converts bounding boxes to a single point of reference
- dabble.check_large_groups # Checks if number of objects in a group exceeds a threshold.
- dabble.check_nearby_objs # Checks if detected objects are near each other.
- dabble.fps # Estimates the 3D coordinates of an object given a 2D bounding box.
- dabble.group_nearby_objs # Assigns objects in close proximity to groups.
- dabble.keypoints_to_3d_loc # Estimates the 3D coordinates of a human given 2D pose coordinates.

- draw.image_processor # Adjusts brightness of an incoming image.
- draw.legend # Displays info from dabble nodes such as FPS, object count, and zone count in a legend box.
- draw.mosaic_bbox # Mosaics area bounded by bounding boxes over detected object
- draw.poses # Draws keypoints on a detected pose.
- draw.tag # Displays a tag on bounding box
- draw.zones # Draws the 2D boundaries of a zone.

# output
- output.screen # Records the nodes outputs to a CSV file.
- output.media_writer # Writes the output image/video to file.
- output.screen # Shows the outputs on your display.
